# Introduction
The modern, mobile workplace feeds on the ability to be productive fast as well as independent from regional infrastructure. A centerpiece of the modern workplace is the usage of cloud based software-as-a-service (*SaaS*) solutions and clean provisioned devices, allowing the access to corporate data and software in a short time. 
With Windows 10 as central OS, Azure AD for identity management and Microsoft Intune MDM service to manage all user devices, Microsoft offers a nearly complete package for an efficient work environment. However, Microsoft Intune lacks the ability to manage *classic Win32* applications.

RealmJoin is developed as a 'Companion to Intune', solving the *classic Win32 software gap* when using Microsoft Intune in corporate and enterprise environments, 
and providing a broad range of additional feature to elevate the management and general working experience.
